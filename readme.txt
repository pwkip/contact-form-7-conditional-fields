Adds conditional logic to Contact Form 7.

== Description ==

This plugin adds conditional logic to [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/).

If you edit your CF7 form, you will see an additional tag called "Conditional fields Group". Everything you put between the start and end tag will be hidden by default.
After you have added the field group(s), go to the "Conditional fields" tab to create one or more conditions that will make the group(s) appear.

= How to use it =

[Follow this tutorial](https://conditional-fields-cf7.bdwm.be/conditional-fields-for-contact-form-7-tutorial/)

== Main features ==

= Support for required fields =

Required fields inside hidden groups will never trigger validation errors.

= Hide/show info in emails based on what groups are visible =

Conditional groups can now be added to the emails as well.
Just wrap the content with `[group-name] ... [/group-name]` tags.

= Groups can be nested =
Groups can be nested, both in the form and in the email

Example form:
`
[group group-1]
  [group group-inside-1]
    ...
  [/group]
[/group]`

Example email:
`
[group-1]
  [group-inside-1]
    ...
  [/group-inside-1]
[/group-1]`

= Advanced =

Advanced users can code up the conditions as plain text instead of using the select boxes, using the Text View.

== Need more power? ==

Just like WordPress, the power of Contact Form 7 lies in its [rich eco-system of extensions](https://conditional-fields-cf7.bdwm.be/list-of-all-contact-form-7-extensions/) that build on top of it. However, it can be difficult to find a set of complex extensions that work well together.

That's why I created Conditional Fields Pro. It adds some powerful features to Contact form 7 and guarantees that everything will run smoothly with Conditional Fields.

Pro features include:

* Repeatable fields (repeaters)
* Forms with multiple steps (multistep)
* Custom conditions with JavaScript functions
* Additional operators ( greater than, less than, .. )

== Installation ==

Please follow the [standard installation procedure for WordPress plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

Follow [this tutorial](https://conditional-fields-cf7.bdwm.be/conditional-fields-for-contact-form-7-tutorial/) if you are not sure how to use the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Email message is not showing the correct values / Wrong values are submitted =

<strong>All field names should be unique</strong>

Even though your fields might never show up at the same time, it is still important to realize that WPCF7CF will not remove the fields, it merely hides them. So all fields will be submitted when the form is sent. Because of this no two fields can have the same name.

Incorrect form (2 input elements having the same name "a"):
`
[group group-1][select a "1" "2" "3"][/group]
[group group-2][select a "1" "2" "3"][/group]
`

Correct form (all groups and fields have unique names):
`
[group group-1][select a "1" "2" "3"][/group]
[group group-2][select b "1" "2" "3"][/group]
`

= All my groups show up all the time and never get hidden. =

<strong>Reason #1: Javascript error</strong>
Check your browser console (F12) for any javascript errors. WPCF7CF loads it's scripts at the bottom of the HTML page, so if some javascript error gets triggered before that, the code will not be executed in most browsers.
Before reaching out to the support forum try to determine which plugin or theme is causing the problem, by gradually disabling plugins and changing theme.

<strong>Reason #2: wp_footer() isn't loaded</strong>
Check if your theme is calling the `wp_footer()` function. Typically this function will be called in your theme's footer.php file.
The conditional fields javascript code is loaded during wp_footer, so a call to this function is crucial. If there is no such call in your theme, go to your theme's footer.php file and add this code right before the closing `</body>` tag:
`&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;`

* disable automatic insertion of paragraphs. Recent CF7 updates have changed the autop mechanism, causing too many problems with parsing the HTML code. If you still want to use autop (at your own risk) copy this code to your functions.php file: `add_filter( 'wpcf7_autop_or_not', '__return_true', 41, 0);`. Untill further notice Conditional Fields and Conditional Fields for Contact Form 7 will not use the automatic paragraph feature of CF7. Always try to write clean and valid HTML code.

* PRO Repeater: The string `{{your-repeater_index}}` inside a repeater called `your-repeater` will be replaced with the index of the current sub repeater. [Check out the updated example](https://conditional-fields-cf7.bdwm.be/repeater/)  

= 1.7.7 (2019-11-05) =
* PRO: Fix problem with parsing the "function" operator

= 1.7.6 (2019-11-01) =
* Fixed small compatibility problem with CF7 Smart Grid [link](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/problem-on-save-form-when-the-active-tabs-are-not-conditional-form/#post-12085173)
* Fixed some more porblems with parsing conditions (regex changes)
* Got rid of screen_icon notice on CF settings page

= 1.7.5 (2019-10-31) =
* Fixed bug in admin where settings got cleared if using some operators (mostly PRO operators)

= 1.7.4 (2019-10-29) =
* PRO: made repeater (80%) compatible with material-design-for-contact-form-7
* PRO: made exclusive checkbox work with repeater fields
* PRO: trigger events when a repeater adds fields: 'wpcf7cf_repeater_added' - and when a repeater removes fields: 'wpcf7cf_repeater_removed'. Can be called with `$('form').on('wpcf7cf_repeater_removed', function() { /*...*/ })`
* PRO: fixed bug with mutistep (formn did not work correctly if there were multiple forms on one page).

= 1.7.3 (2019-10-24) =
* removed @babel/polyfill. All seems to be working fine without it in IE11. JS file is now back to 25kb instead of 100kb.

= 1.7.2 (2019-10-24) =
* Bug fix: new javascript files where throwing errors. Should be okay now. (Also included JS source map for easier debugging)

= 1.7.1 (2019-10-23) =
* PRO: Added basic support for multistep. No options available yet. You can insert [step] tags inside your code. [More info](https://conditional-fields-cf7.bdwm.be/multistep/)
* Set up an NPM dev environment with babel and webpack. This means all the client side JS code will look super ugly, and it's also more bytes. But the plus side is that the plugin should also work fine in older browsers now.
* Tested with WP version 5.3

= 1.7 (2019-10-18) =
* code rewrite. Made code more testable by focusing more on a functional approach. Not completely finished yet, but getting there.
* FIXED clear_on_hide not working for multi select [github issue 35](https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/35)
* PRO: FIXED [github issue 34](https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/34) - A real nest fest is now possible. You can put groups inside repeaters inside repeaters inside groups ...
* FIXED make clear_on_hide restore initial values instead of clearing [github issue 31](https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/31)
* WP-admin: Renamed "Import/Export" to "Text view". Conditions specified in the input fields are now semi-automatically synced with the text view.
* Internal change: When saving conditions, instead of posting all the input fields, the input fields are added to the "text view" textarea, and only the textarea will be sent. This is to prevent issues with PHP max_input_vars

= 1.6.5 (2019-10-15) =
* Patched a minor security issue. From now on, only users with the 'wpcf7_edit_contact_form' capability will be able to reset the Conditional Fields settings to their defaults. Big thanks to Chloe from Wordfence for pointing this out!
* Tested the plugin with WP version 5.2.4

= 1.6.4 (2019-07-04) =
* PRO: Repeater: Fixed invalid HTML for the remove button
* Free: Initialize form.$groups as a new jQuery object instead of an empty array, in order to prevent exotic bugs in case $groups aren't loaded by the time form.displayFields() is called. (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/typeerror-cannot-read-property-addclass-of-undefined-at-wpcf7cfform/)

= 1.6.3 (2019-07-04) =
* Removed the word "Pro" from the title in the free plugin

= 1.6.2 (2019-06-25) =
* Small changes to tag generator buttons
* Multistep bug fix. All group conditions are evaluated a second time after the page has fully loaded.
* PRO: added new operator 'function', allowing you to write custom javascript functions to determine whether or not a group should be shown. [link](https://conditional-fields-cf7.bdwm.be/advanced-conditional-logic-with-custom-javascript-functions/)
* PRO: fix bug with < (less than) operator

= 1.6.1 (2019-06-03) =
* JS refactoring and small compatibility fix after code rewrite.
* FREE: Added "Get PRO" button under Contact > Conditional Fields

= 1.6 (2019-06-01) =
* JS code rewrite
* PRO: allow groups inside repeater
* PRO: make plugin ready for PRO release.

= 1.5.5 (2019-05-20) =
* Fixed and explained how to disable loading of the styles and scripts and only enable it on certain pages. [More info](https://conditional-fields-cf7.bdwm.be/docs/faq/can-i-load-js-and-css-only-when-necessary/)
* Made sure default settings get set after activating plugin, without the need to visit the Contact > Conditional Fields page first.
* PRO: extended the repeater with min and max paramaters and the possibility to change the add and remove buttons texts
* PRO: enabling the pro plugin will show a notification to disable the free plugin, instead of throwing a PHP error.

= 1.5.4 (2019-05-06) =
* Make sure scripts get loaded late enough (wp_enqueue_scripts priority set to 20), because there was a problem with multistep where the multistep script was changing a value after the cf script ran. https://wordpress.org/support/topic/1-5-x-not-expanding-selected-hidden-groups-with-multi-step-on-previous-page/

= 1.5.3 (2019-05-03) =
* Refix the fix from version 1.4.3 that got unfixed in version 1.5 somehow 🙄

= 1.5.2 (2019-05-03) =
* by reverting changes in 1.5.1, the possibility to load forms via AJAX was destroyed. So, from now on the wpcf7cf scripts will be loaded in the 'wp_enqueue_scripts' hook. Analogous with the WPCF7_LOAD_JS constant, a new constant is defined called WPCF7CF_LOAD_JS wich is set to true by default.

= 1.5.1 (2019-05-02) =
* revert changes: enqueue scripts in 'wpcf7_contact_form' hook instead of 'wpcf7_enqueue_scripts', because loading it in the latter would cause problems with plugins that disable WPCF7_LOAD_JS (like for example contact-form-7-paypal-add-on).

= 1.5 (2019-04-21) =
* Make it possible to load forms with AJAX. [fixed github issue 25](https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/25). [updated docs](https://conditional-fields-cf7.bdwm.be/docs/faq/how-to-initialize-the-conditional-logic-after-an-ajax-call/)
* Massive code reorganization in scripts.js
* Fixed bug that could appear after removing an AND condition.
* solve WPCF7_ADMIN_READ_WRITE_CAPABILITY - https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/pull/16
* disable part of the faulty remove_hidden_post_data function. - https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/pull/17
* Fix "Dismiss notice" on Conditional Fields Settings page
* use the "wpcf7_before_send_mail" hook instead of "wpcf7_mail_components" to hide mail groups. The wpcf7_before_send_mail hook is called earlier, so it allows to also hide groups in the attachment field and in messages.
* Allow conditional group tags in success and error messages. https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/23
* duplicating a form will also duplicate conditions https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/28

= 1.4.3 (2019-04-12) =
* Really fix clear_on_hide problem (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/clear_on_hide-still-not-working-right-after-1-4-2-update/)

= 1.4.2 (2019-04-10) =
* Disabled mailbox syntax errors if there are group tags present. (this is overkill, and should be changed if the necassary hooks become available) https://wordpress.org/support/topic/filter-detect_invalid_mailbox_syntax/
* Checked issue: https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/26 (nothing changed, but turns out to be working fine)
* Fixed issue where mail_2 added extra lines in the email message. https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/30
* Made the clear_on_hide property a bit more useful (https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/27)
* Got rid of warning in PHP 7 (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/compatibility-warning-message-regarding-wpcf7_admin_read_write_capability/)
* Fixed some javascript errors that appeared on non-CF7CF subpages of CF7
* Tested WP version 5.1.1

= 1.4.1 (2018-08-21) =
* Fixed some CSS issues (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/crash-view-admin-the-list-of-posts-entry/)
* Dropped support for PHP version 5.2, now PHP 5.3+ is required to run the plugin. Let's push things forward!
* Added conditional group support to mail attachments field (https://github.com/pwkip/contact-form-7-conditional-fields/issues/22)
* Added repeater field to PRO version.

= 1.4 (2018-08-15) =
* Added basic drag and drop functionality to the back-end so conditional rules can be rearranged.
* Added possibility to create inline groups by adding the option inline. Example: `[group my-group inline] ... [/group]`
* Added property clear_on_hide to clear all fields within a group the moment the group gets hidden. Example: `[group my-group clear_on_hide] ... [/group]`
* Added AND conditions and added a bunch of other options in the PRO version (should be released very soon now)
* Bug fix thanks to Aurovrata Venet (@aurovrata) https://wordpress.org/support/topic/bug-plugin-overwrite-cf7-hidden-fields/
* Bug fix thanks to 972 creative (@toddedelman) https://wordpress.org/support/topic/conditional-fields-not-opening-using-radio-buttons/#post-10442923

= 1.3.4 =
* small fix (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wpcf7_contactform-object-is-no-longer-accessible/)

= 1.3.3 =
* Changes tested with WP 4.7.5 and CF7 4.8
* Changed the inner mechanics a bit to make the plugin more edge-case proof and prepare for future ajax support
* Fix problems introduced by CF7 4.8 update
* Because the CF7 author, Takayuki Miyoshi, decided to get rid of the 'form-pre-serialize' javascript event, the hidden fields containing data about which groups are shown/hidden will now be updated when the form is loaded and each time a form value changes. This might make the plugin slightly slower, but it is the only solution I found so far.
* Small bug fix (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-depreciated-warning/#post-9151404)

= 1.3.2 =
* Removed a piece of code that was trying to load a non existing stylesheet

* Removed some debug code
* Updated readme file

* Update JS en CSS version numbers
* Fix PHP warning with forms that are not using conditional fields (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/conditional-formatting-error/)
* Tested on WP 4.7.1

= 0.2.9 =
* Re-added wpcf7_add_shortcode() function if wpcf7_add_form_tag() is not found, because some people claimed to get a "function not found" error for the wpcf7_add_form_tag function with the latest version of CF7 installed. (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/activation-issue-5/ and https://wordpress.org/support/topic/http-500-unable-to-handle-request-error-after-update/)

= 0.2.7 =
* Added support for conditional fields in the email (2) field
* Got rid of some PHP warnings
* Saving a form only once, directly after adding or removing conditions, caused conditional logic not to work. This is fixed now. Thanks to @cpaprotna for pointing me in the right direction. (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-more-than-3-conditional-statements/)

* Tested the plugin with WP 4.7

= 0.2.2 =
* Prevent strict standards notice to appear while adding new group via the "Conditional Fields Group" popup.
* Only load cf7cf admin styles and scripts on cf7 pages.
* groups are now reset to their initial states after the form is successfully submitted.

= 0.2.1 =
* Bug fix: arrow kept spinning after submitting a form without conditional fields. (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/version-0-2-gives-a-continues-spinning-arrow-after-submitting/)
* Removed anonymous functions from code, so the plugin also works for PHP versions older than 5.3.
* Suppress errors generated if user uses invalid HTML markup in their form code. These errors could prevent form success message from appearing.

= 0.2 =
